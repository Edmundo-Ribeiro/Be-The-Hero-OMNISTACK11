## :question: What it is
Be The Hero is a project developed during the "Semana Omnistack 11.0" provided by, <span id="rocket">[@Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat)</span> where I learned to use the stack [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and a lot of other technologies in this ecosytem to implement a rest api that provided the data and bisiness rules for the frontend and the mobile aplication.

## :rocket: The Idea

** Be The Hero ** is a platform that connects NGOs and people.
It allows NGOs to report incidents that they are working on, so that Heroes can get in touch and help with costs as well as better understand the work of NGOs in the community.
